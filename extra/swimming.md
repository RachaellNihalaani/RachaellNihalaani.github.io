Swimming is not the easiest of sports. It takes courage, dedication and a lot of hard work to become a swimmer. But swimming isn’t all about the medals you win or the constant tan lines or the chlorine in your hair.

Swimming provides the groundwork for some of the most fundamental frameworks in our lives. It teaches us life lessons that you carry with you for the rest of your life, long after you’ve hung your togs up. These life lessons won’t just disappear when you finish but will help you throughout your life.

**Persistence**

There are no easy shortcuts to success in life, or in the pool. To reach your goals, hard work and dedication are critical. Swimming teaches you that training hard, working on technique and stamina in the water are the keys to becoming a great swimmer. It’s important to keep going, to swim as often as you can, so that valuable skills hard-gained are not lost. To be dedicated, consistent and to push yourself to achieve goals will get you far in the pool, and in general life.

Learning to swim can be hard, and sometimes it might feel like you’ve hit a wall. It’s at times like these that you can feel like you’ve failed in some way, and it’s easy to give up. Learning to process these feelings, and continue to be positive and committed is an invaluable skill that will improve your life in and out of the water.

**Self-Discipline/ How to Be Mentally Disciplined**

Self-discipline is essential in becoming a great swimmer. Learning to swim takes a lot of practice! You won’t get very far being slack, and not having a schedule in place for swimming lessons. Great swimmers learn that having a routine, and making swimming a fundamental part of that routine is critical to their success. Swimmers are the first to hop out of bed when the alarm goes off, even on cold, dark mornings, because they have learned how important it is to be serious and consistent about training. Prioritising and making time for the things we are passionate about and want to succeed at, are critical lessons that swimming can teach you, which will improve your life immeasurably.

Sometimes, it can be hard to balance things we love to do, with the rest of our busy daily lives. If you lose motivation in the pool, it’s very easy to see the backwards-steps you take in the skills you have worked so hard to develop. Swimmers learn that maintaining a positive attitude is a choice we must all make to persevere with difficult, but rewarding activities in our daily lives. Swimming is a fantastic way to learn how to maintain positive daily routines and habits.

Goal-setting is another important feature of self-discipline that can be learned in the pool. Making goals for ourselves, and putting together a suitable framework to succeed in them is important to having a meaningful, fulfilled life. You have to work hard to achieve your goals as a swimmer, but whether it’s perfecting technique, or stamina, it is obvious when goals in the pool have paid off. Learning to cope with advice, criticism, failures and setbacks are all important lessons that swimming can teach us.

Mind over body.

My coach once told me that if you’re uncomfortable and you back off because of that discomfort, you’ll never reach your fullest potential.

It’s when you reach that breaking point and push past it that you increase your pain threshold, that you grow, that you improve.

If you want proof, it’s a tangible thing. I’ve felt it—when you reach that point, you have a choice. You can either back down, or you can push past it.

That choice sets you up for the rest of practice, and potentially, the rest of the season.

The magic that happens once you decide to break past your threshold? You don’t feel any more physical pain. You feel like you’re floating, as if you could go forever.

And what happens if you decide to back down? You spend the rest of the practice dying a little bit but not quite enough to improve.

It takes more mental strength than physical strength to finish a set sometimes. It takes so much mental strength to jump in the pool and give it your all when it’s your second practice of the day and you have 2 brutal hours in front of you and you’re so tired you just want to sink to the bottom of the pool. But that strength to keep going is what differentiates between an average swimmer and a fast swimmer.

**Teamwork Makes the Dream Work/ You’re Always Part of Something Bigger Than Yourself**

Swimming is as much an individual sport as it is a team sport.  While most of the time, you swim to achieve your own success and goals, you couldn’t do that without the help of your teammates right next to you.

There are no closer teammates than those you’ll find in swimming. You spend countless hours in the pool together, following the black line up and down, pushing each other that little bit further in tough sessions. You cheer each other on from the sidelines at Nationals and pick each other up when you’ve had a bad swim.

Your teammate’s success is your success. Enduring the same brutal sessions and heartbreaks throughout your swimming career builds bonds that never break and will stay with you for life. Likewise, learning to work as a team is essential for success in your professional life where you are accountable for your own success but also your teams to make sure the company succeeds.

You meet all kinds of people learning to swim. Swimming is for everyone, so people from all walks of life get involved; very old and very young, people from diverse cultural backgrounds and people with disabilities. Meeting people you may not have met otherwise, in private lessons, at the public pool or beach, is a wonderful way of expanding your social circle, and understanding of the world. This will help you have a much richer, fuller life.

Learning to interact with people in a positive way is very important in and out of the pool. The water can be dangerous, so it’s very important for swimmers to accommodate each other, and be aware of each other’s needs.

There are many ways to take your swimming skills to the next level; involving yourself in a swimming squad, training as a lifeguard, or even a rescue diver! Being a team player, and learning to interact with your peers in what can be dangerous, high-pressure environments, is critical for your own safety and enjoyment, and that of those around you.

Swimming may be an individual sport, but there are no teammates closer than swimmers. When you spend 15+ hours in the pool together, pushing each other to go faster for longer, when you nap on each others’ shoulders and sing along to Taylor Swift on long bus rides to swim meets, when you endure the same brutal sets, you build a bond that never breaks.

At meets, you may be competing against your teammates in some events, but you’re scored as a team. Even beyond that, your teammate’s success is your success. You’re happy for them. You know they’ve worked hard for that PR, for that first place, for that relay spot. Not that you haven’t worked hard, but you are happy for them nonetheless.

You go and look at your teammates, at the awesome things that they’re accomplishing, and you don’t begrudge them. You don’t hate the faster swimmers, you love them. You look up to them. And you support them.

Relays especially—I’ve seen people pull amazing feats on the relays. One obvious example is Jason Lezak’s leg at the 2008 Olympics, when he helped Michael Phelps win another Olympic gold medal. It’s because you’re not swimming for yourself. You’re swimming for your team, for your teammates; you’re part of something bigger than yourself.

**Confidence**
Swimming is a great mood booster, no matter what level of ability you are. There is something about the solitude of just you and the feeling of the water rushing over your body that gets the endorphins pumping.

It helps build not only your mental strength but also your physical strength. Building muscle, improving flexibility and fitness all boost your confidence and leave you feeling on top of the world.

Swimming with friends who support your achievements, encourage you throughout training and congratulate you on your efforts after a race builds your self-confidence. This is essential to have throughout your life. If you have confidence, you can achieve anything you want in life, get that dream job, or travel the world.

Swimming is a wonderful confidence booster. It is a skill set that opens doors to many interesting opportunities, and has a positive impact on your physical and mental health.

Being fit and healthy, in body and mind, is the best way to build up confidence.  Swimming strengthens all the major muscle groups, enhances flexibility, endurance, circulation, and energy levels. Swimming has also been shown to have a positive effect on mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.

Achieving goals that you have worked diligently to accomplish will dramatically improve self-confidence and self-esteem. Learning to swim with peers, who can congratulate you on your efforts, and who you can help to teach, mentor and encourage, will also help to build confidence. It is so important when navigating through life recognise your own achievements, as well as those of your peers, and to be confident in your abilities.

**How You Lose is as Important as How You Win**

Losing sucks. Let’s be honest, nobody likes to lose. You don’t go into a race and hope to lose. You go in wanting to win and come out on top. But how you lose is just as important as how you win. How you handle both outcomes matters more than where you finish in the race.

Throughout your swimming career, you will have many triumphs, but you will also lose many times. What matters is that when you lose, you turn to the person next to you and congratulate the winner, shake their hand or say great job. Never snub them. This shows your character and sportsmanship, and it shows you are bigger than the outcome and are humbled by not only your wins but your defeats, too.

Most of all, it sets a good example for the younger swimmers, who idolize you, whether you know it or not. Learning to be humble in defeat will get you far in your professional life. You might lose that dream job to the person next to you, but you can smile, say congratulations and try again.

**How You Work Under Pressure**
Meets are even more of a mental game. I’ve had meets where I’ve cried in the warm-up/cool-down pool because I was so upset over my times. I had such high expectations for myself, and I felt like I let myself down.

I’ve hit plateaus, when I know I’ve worked as hard as I can, put in as many hours as I can, and my times don’t budge. When you’re a swimmer, every millisecond counts.

And I’ve had meets where everything works perfectly. There are many physical factors of meets (rain, nutrition, sleep, etc.), but more importantly, the mental stress is something you have to learn to handle — you learn how you work under pressure, what triggers you and what doesn’t, and how to optimize your stress and adrenaline.

**Make the Most Out of Life/ Enjoying Life/ How to Find Peace in the Chaos**

Life should be enjoyed. We all get told, “life is short; make the most of it,” and that saying is so true. Swimming teaches you to enjoy life in many ways. The practices, team get-togethers, early mornings, late nights and many carnivals we attend throughout our time as a swimmer.

Even on the hardest of days, when our limbs are aching and our eyes are tired from previous practices, somehow, us swimmers find the light and enjoyment in everything. We hop out of the pool smiling and continue with our day, doing everything that brings us enjoyment.

Swimming has taught me that everything I do in and out of the pool, I should enjoy, and if I don’t enjoy it, then don’t do it because life is about enjoying yourself and making the most of it.
How to Overcome Adversity

Swimming isn’t always going to be fair. It’s not always going to go your way, and the same can be said for life. There will be times in your career as a swimmer that no matter how hard you train or how many extra sessions you do, your effort in training will not match the results in the race.

You will be disappointed, it will hurt and cut deep, and you will want to give up, but when this happens, it’s important not to give up but to persevere and keep going, push through, work on the one-percenters and try again.

How you overcome obstacles and adversity is bigger than any win. If you master this skill, you will go far in life because life will knock you down many times, but it’s how to get back up again and continue to persevere and achieve your goals is what counts.

Life should be lived to be enjoyed, and we should all aim to have fun and be happy in our everyday routines. Swimming teaches us to enjoy our lives in many ways. It allows us to access peace and tranquillity amidst our busy and often stressful working lives. It is an outlet that enhances our physical and mental health.

Swimming opens the door to many activities that make life fun and exciting; sports, activities like deep sea diving and snorkelling and spending days at the beach, the pool, or the river with friends and family. Enjoying life, and seeking out the tools to make the most of it, is the most important goal we can set for ourselves.

These are just five important life lessons that swimming can teach you. Learning to swim is a journey, and once that takes dedication, hard work and commitment. The skills and experience this affords you can be utilised in all areas of your life. If you are thinking about learning to swim, jump in! It will dramatically improve your life in ways you wouldn’t have imagined.

There’s nothing as peaceful as diving into a completely still pool, with the sunlight filtering through the clear water. Even when the pool is crowded and basically a madhouse, with 10+ people per lane, you can find peace if you try. You lose yourself in the water, in your own thoughts, in the steady inhale exhale inhale exhale.

You become in tune with your breath. You learn to find peace in the busiest of moments, to breathe in and out as you need, to find a home in the solitude of the water, and know that if you ever want to return to the hustle and bustle of life, you can.

**Time Management/ How to Prioritize and Schedule My Time Wisely**
Swimming is a very time-consuming sport, but that doesn’t matter to us swimmers because we love it. We learn from an early age that time management is everything and how to handle our time to get the most out of it. We have to practice at 5 a.m., then school or university all day, followed by practice again in the afternoon. Most nights we don’t get home until 7 or 8 p.m.

Swimming teaches us to schedule our time efficiently while juggling our training, schoolwork and social life. If we don’t, we end up drowning in schoolwork, missing practices and time with friends. The juggle seems hard at times, but when you start your professional life, you will be thankful to have these skills.

Balancing workouts, going to the gym, working all day and still having time to socialize with friends is the dream and us swimmers can do it with our eyes closed. We’ve had that much practice.

When your day starts at 5AM with practice, then a full day of school, and then another practice and you don’t get home until 7 or 8PM, you learn to schedule your time efficiently so that you can finish your homework and make it to practice and sleep.

There’s no time for BS or procrastinating here—if you waste your time, you find yourself drowning in schoolwork, which your parents and teachers will yell at you for; not making it to practice, which your coaches will yell at you for; not sleeping, which you’ll yell at yourself for.

My favorite way of scheduling is via iCal and a physical planner (I swear by the Passion Planner or a bullet journal), but you’ll quickly find what works for you.

**Learn from People Better Than You—Regardless of Their Age**
Swimming is humbling because oftentimes, people who are younger than you are faster. Whether that’s because they started when they were five, are naturally talented, or just have youth on their side, who knows.

But that doesn’t mean that you can’t learn from them. Age is irrelevant; whether it’s pre-race routines, technique, after-practice refueling, etc., there are always tips to be shared.

Fear Nothing
I didn’t realize how many people were afraid of swimming in the deep water where you can’t see the bottom or see the end of the horizon.

But swimming taught me to lose my fear of the unknown. To dive into the deep and know that it’ll be ok. Both metaphorically and literally.

Growing up by Malibu, we’d drive to the beach and swim out as far as we could until we couldn’t stand and the shore was far in the distance. We’d stay in until it was too cold. We didn’t fear losing sight of the shore, didn’t fear being crushed by the waves, didn’t fear anything.
